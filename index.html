											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I was born in Melbourne in 1992. I also lived in Turkey.
											So, I can speak Turkish, too. I really miss Turkey.
											I enjoy living in Melbourne, by the way. I am currently
											studying IT at RMIT University. I started studying this
											year at 2. Semester, in 2020. There are lots of
											opportunities in here in terms of education, business,
											nature. I like animals, nature, self-development through
											cultural interactions. I like jogging, fishing and playing
											soccer.

										<h3>What is my interest in IT? </h3>
										<p>Since my childhood, I have been curious about how people are
											able to talk to each other through Internet, how technology is
											designed and how programming is done. My intention to study
											IT has come real with the help of my friend who is also studying IT.
											I realised that studying IT is something I could do.
											I do not have much IT experience though I plan to master in IT and
											other IT related areas such as cyber security.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
										<p>I chose to study at RMIT, because it is one of the best
											universities in Melbourne. It also has popularity around
											the world. IT courses’ structure at RMIT suits my needs
											 and my expectations. Academics at RMIT are really good at
											 their jobs and they are lovely teachers. RMIT’s website is
											 very professional.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-gem"></span>
										<h3>What do I expect to learn?</h3>
										<p>During my studies, I expect to have a good understanding
											of IT when I complete my bachelor degree. The course content
											 itself includes main programming languages such as phyton
											 and Java and other technical information. While I am learning
											 what my degree suggest me, I also want to add extra skills.</p>

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									<p>My ideal It project is about something that brings software
										 and daily life needs together. The project is about
										 commanding to electrical devices and controlling them.People have electrical devices such as oven, air-conditioner, Tv, computer, fridge and so on. We always need to control them by touching their buttons. When we are close to these devices, we can control them easily. What if we are far from these devices and we need to control them. Then, we need to change our location. This means we lose time, energy and time. This project will save us energy, time and money. By having a online control over a device, we would be able to monitor and control them. And this project should interest very broad range of people no matter what their job is, no matter what their age is and no matter where they live, because everyone deals with electrical devices in some way.</p>
