								<h2>What is the Project?</h2>
								<p>My ideal IT project is about something that brings software and daily life needs together. The project is about commanding to electrical devices and controlling them. For example; the shop owners have shops that have devices like air-conditioner. Sometimes, after they close their shops, on the way to home, they remember that they forgot to turn the air-conditioner off. Then, they return to shop, close the machine and go home which is really frustrating and time wasting. At this point, they will have an application which may be accessible via mobile phone or laptops and they will be able to control the machine, so they will be able to control electrical devices even when they are far from their shops.</p>
								<h2>What is the Current Problem?</h2>
								<p>People have electrical devices such as oven, air-conditioner, Tv, computer, fridge and so on. We always need to control them by touching their buttons. When we are close to these devices, we can control them easily. What if we are far from these devices and we need to control them. Then, we need to change our location. This means we lose time, energy and time. This project will save us energy, time and money. By having a online control over a device, we would be able to monitor and control them. And this project should interest very broad range of people no matter what their job is, no matter what their age is and no matter where they live, because everyone deals with electrical devices in some way.</p>
								<h2>Description of the Product or Service </h2>
								<p>When it comes to description of the features of the product or service, I will start with on what devices we can implement this service. At the first step, devices that we can use our project on include any electrical devices that we use at home such as oven, air-conditioner, Tv, computer, fridge and computer. After that, if needed, we can implement the project on the devices that we use for work or the ones that are used in companies such as big working machines such as excavators, other any working machines that you can think of. And after that it can be implemented on any electrical device that you want to implement where it needed.</p>

								<p>Probably, you may have heard of the airplanes that work without someone in it.  I have the similar logic in my project. But, to be able to realize my project I need to use robotics.</p>
								<p>"A robot is a machine with sensors and mechanical components connected to and controlled by electronic boards or CPUs. They process information and apply changes to the physical world. Robots are mostly autonomous and replace or help humans in everything from daily routines to very dangerous tasks."[1]</p>
								<p>“There are three steps involved. First, you get motors and sensors running using off-the-shelf drivers. Then you develop basic building blocks so that you can move the robot and read its sensors. Finally, use that to develop smart, complex software routines to create your desired behaviour.”[2]</P>
								<p>However; in my project, I will create a robot-like device, so instead of sensors, I will use pre-determined commands using a programming language, for the moment at least. I will just give commands to my machine by using an online application. When I give a command to a device, it will process the command and quickly do what I tell it to do.</p>
								<p>As it comes to how devices will process commands, we normally press a button on a device to make it work. When we press a button, it gives electrical signals to the device and it works. In my product though, I will use code commands which also gives electrical signals to device by using web control instead of buttons, we may still have concrete buttons on our devices though.</p>
								<p>Next, when we buy new robot-like device, it will have both remote control and web control or application control feature. Our device will have a key code that we will use in our online application. We, then, will download an application that will be developed along with our product, then set up an account, enter the code to that account. And with this account, we will be able to control our device. The application will be downloaded to our mobile phones and computers.</p>

								<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
								<p>“Two main programming languages are the best when used in robotics: C++ and Python. C++ is used in control loops, image processing and to interface low-level hardware. Python is used to handle high-level behaviours and to quickly develop tests or proof of concepts.”[3]</p>
								<p>“Other than programming languages, we may need to use Raspberry Pi. ‘The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins that allow you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things.”[4]</p>
								<p>We also need to develop an online application to access our device which will need a web access to access a device later on.</p>

								<h2>Skills Required</h2>
								<p>To be able to create my project, I need to use software programming languages such as phyton, C++ and maybe Java. As it comes to hardware, I need to apply to robotics science or maybe Raspberry Pi.  To be able to design the application, I need to use html, JavaScript, and CSS. With our current technology, the project seems to be very possible in the near future. It is also feasible in terms of the need for the software, skills and hardware required.</p>
								<h2>Result</h2>
								<p>In conclusion, with the current technology, we can produce very skilled robots to help us in daily life. So, it is also very possible that my project will come true very soon. If the project is successful, our lives will be easier when we need to control electrical devices. When we are far from our homes or work places, we will still be able to control them. The problem of losing energy, time and money will be solved. Lastly, it will have a significant impact on our lives and on our devices.</p>
